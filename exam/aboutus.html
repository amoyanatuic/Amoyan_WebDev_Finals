    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p class="text">An online store web application site which clients place orders. It might speak to a little nearby store, a  significant retailer, an online business store or a person who sells ventures through an outsider webpage, for example, eBay. The online store can work under various plans of action, including business-to-shopper, business-to-business or buyer to customer. To work an online store, you'll need an item list, a shopping basket, and different things.</p>
